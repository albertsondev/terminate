TERMINATE
=========
**TERMINATE** is a browser-based cracking game played through an emulated
terminal modeled off of \*NIX. It's written entirely in the three vanilla web
languages (HTML5/CSS3/ES2019), and will ideally be kept that way.

## Purpose
It's primarily meant as a showcase of certain skills with JavaScript, and shall
be kept documentation-heavy to aid in understanding and be used as a reference
for some novices. Redundant comments and the likes won't be included; however,
most data structures and algorithms employed, as well as larger architectural
concepts, will ideally be explained as thoroughly as possible.

Beyond that, browser support (minimally, the most recent versions of Chromium
and Firefox) should be respected, and, perhaps most importantly of all, the game
should be fun!

## Documentation
Documentation of the general project structure is provided for reference and
convenience [here](./docs/).
